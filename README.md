# [Project 1: Blytz Megaplex](https://github.com/billywibowo7/Blytz-Megaplex)
by Billy Wibowo (2201762326)

This is my submission for Human and Computer Interaction Quiz.

- Blytz Megaplex is a dummy cinema and it is developing a website that will provide an explanation about Blytz Megaplex, 
current partners of Blytz Megaplex, hoverable Blytz Megaplex facility pictures, and list of now showing movies.
Beside that, this website will also provide a feedback form for their customers in order to give feedback about the development team
of Blytz Megaplex.

- The Blytz Megaplex website has 2 pages consist of homepage and feedback page created with html and css. 
This website design must be simple and easy-understanding because it targets customers from all ages. It also has interactive feature such as
the image is changed when they are hover and the all of the button are clickable and visible.

RX-Player is a group project for Human and Computer Interaction final assignment.

RX player is a digital music player company formed in December 2019 and located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The main purpose of the RX player is to provide millions of high-quality songs from any of the countries all around the world. RX player also provides all kinds of genres. Songs in RX players are always updated every day. The user can also be the creator that can upload their song to the RX player and share that song privately or publicly.

This project is using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

# [Project 3: Classification and Clustering in Machine Learning (Big Data Processing)](https://github.com/billywibowo7/Big-Data-Processing)
by Billy Wibowo (2201762326)



Classification in Machine Learning: This program is to create a predictive model that will classify whether a planet is likely habitable or not from given data "Planet_Training.csv" and "Planet_Testing.csv". The goal of this program is to make classification model and test it to "Planet_Testing.csv"

First, is Load Data from given file “Planet_Training.csv” and “Planet_Testing.csv” using SparkSession
Second is to select important features that will be used for training. In this we should pick three important features (My selection is Temperature, Water, and Atmosphere Color)
Third, we should remove any mising values in the data
Fourth is to transform raw data so that can be suitable for training
Fifth step is to normalize the data using StandardScaler package
Sixth, Generate a model from the data using LogisticRegression package with 10 as the max iteration
And last but not least, after the model is generated, you can test the model to predict whether the planet will be habitable or not using BinaryClassificationEvaluator package to print the accuracy of your model. Get the model with minimum accuracy 90% or higher

CLustering in Machine Learning: This program is to make a clustering model that will have 2 cluster, grizzly bear cluster and non-grizzly bear cluster with given files  “BearTraining.csv” and “BearTesting.csv”

1.	Load Data
 Load the data from “BearTraining.csv” and “BearTesting.csv” using SparkSession.
2.	Select Features
After load the data, select three important features that will be used for training. My selection is Front Claws, Pupillary Distance, and Ear Shape) 
3.	Data Preprocessing
This step is to remove any missing values in the data.
4.	Transform Data
In this step, transform the raw data so that it is suitable for training. For example, recode the ‘Ear Shape’ column value to be either 0, 1, or 2.
5.	Normalization
After data preprocessing, normalize the data using the StandardScaler package
6.	Generate Model
Next, generate a model from the data using the KMeans package to generate the model into 2 cluster.
7.	Visualization
After the model is generated, visualize the model using the pyplot package. (Also to add x-label, y-label, and title for the plot.)
8.	Model Testing and Evaluation
Then, test the model to check predict whether the data will be in grizzly bear cluster or in the non-grizzly bear cluster and print the accuracy of your model and get the model with minimum accuracy 80% or higher.
